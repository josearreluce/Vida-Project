# Preface
Vida attempts to solve the problem of online health condition diagnosis. The web
application begins by first asking the user for their most notable symptoms, then
continuing to ask further follow-up and clarifying questions about their condition
and potentially relevant, recent behavior and actions (i.e. starting a new medicine,
trying new food, etc.). In combination with baseline health information supplied by
the user (weight, diet, etc.) Vida provides a more specific and accurate diagnosis
than a quick search on Google or WebMD.

# Course specified entries

(1) how to compile

$ git clone https://github.com/josearreluce/Vida-Project.git
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) how to run your code

From within the Vida-Project directory run:
$ python3 -m flask run
Then navigate to the specified port in your browser

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) how to run the unit test cases

First download a chrome webdriver from http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
and place the driver into the test directory.

The UI Tests require downloading this webdriver.

Then from within the tests directory run:
$ pytest

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) please suggest some acceptance tests for the TA to try (i.e., what inputs to use,
    and what outputs are expected)

As iteration 1 deals only with the high-level design and process of our application,
we have yet to populate our database (and thus our graph) with valid symptoms and conditions.
However, you can still create a username and password, login, and begin the questioning
process with our placeholder symptoms and conditions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5) text description of what is implemented. You can refer to the use cases and user stories
    in your design document.

In this iteration we tackled the most basic instance of start_assessment. We also built the
first draft of our front end, created the framework for our database, and built an early version
of Vida's Bayesian graph modeling

(7) changes: have you made any design changes or unit test changes from earlier milestones?

From the front end perspective, we decided against Django and moved to Flask for our framework,
due to its greater flexibility and lower learning curve. Flask also provides tools for handling
users that we found effective and easy to use. As a result, we've decided to split our original
conception for the User class in two. The first part of the class, allowing Users to login and
be identified within the system, is given to Flask. While the second part of the class, storing
user health data for use in identifying their condition, will be given to the database. This
change also meant that start_assessment() is now called by the front end instead of a User class.

+----------+                     +---------------------+                     +---------------+
|   User   | <-----------------> |   Flask/Front End   | <-----------------> | Baysian Graph |
+----------+                     +---------------------+                     +---------------+

This move is in line with a larger move of information modeling out of classes in the application,
and into the databse. Since conditions and symptoms are static information, it didn't make sense
to make them into classes as we had originally intended. Instead, we store this information in
the database, and pull it when creating our graph.

This leads to our next major design change. In our original plan we had the idea to use a graph of connected symptoms and conditions, and the probabilities of their relations to come up with an accurate diagnosis. But we didn't realize the true complexity and challenge of this problem. So in order to create a mathematically robust and correct solution we decided to use a Baysian graph: a directed acyclic graph with conditional probability distributions in each node. So even though the graph node/edge structure is static the conditional probabilities change based on how we traverse the graph in each assessment. This graph is built from the entries in the database.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) others: whatever you want to let the TA know

We no longer unit test the graph explicitly, since its tested implicitly  by the success or failure
of the assessment.

We were theoretically able to get info from database into Baysian model. However, because of how the
Baysian model works conditional probabilities increase exponentially given connections. This means
that using the whole database as it is now takes way too long to create the graph. For the database
transition to work we would have to use a much smaller database with fewer conditions in order for
the algorithm to eventually output. So in the interest of time, as we need to quickly create and
recreate the graph to develop our code, our current graph uses a small number of with the made up
symptoms/conditions. For iteration 2 we will work on making the database smaller and the code
more efficient.

# Iteration 2

## Unit Test Cases
### test_db.py
Comments within the code of this program indicate the newest section for iteration 2. The biggest change we made was restructuring how symptoms, sub symptoms, and conditions relate to each other in accordance with the Bayesian Model graph. We now have conditions relate only to sub symptoms, and sub symptoms only relate to a single symptom. We are also adding columns to the conditions table to indicate the age range of people likely to get the conditions, as well as the typical time that symptoms can be expected to last. Again, populate_db.py and generate_sub_symptoms.py are used to fill and format the database tables, but the best way to test these programs is to query the database and make sure the data is stored the way we expect it to be.

Comments in code provide more specifics as to what each tests do, but we are mainly checking to make sure sub symptoms only map to one symptom, that conditional probabilities are correct, that age ranges for conditions are correct, and that times for conditons are correct. 

Please note: we are implementing several changes to the database currently, so if tests from iteration 1 are now failing because of this, that is only temporary and will be changed once the database has its final form.

To run: at commandline run "pytest test_db.py"
